# BookSearch3

A Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

## Goal:

Re-factor existing code to use GraphQLqueries and mutations to fetch and modify data.

## Issues:

Took multiples tries in order to get a repo to deploy correctly on Heroku. Attempt 3 finally suceeded. I discovered that I was missing my Config Vars in Heroku amongst other problems. All commits are in my first and second repo.

## Results:

I was able to successfully deploy, use hooks and graphQL and search for books.
